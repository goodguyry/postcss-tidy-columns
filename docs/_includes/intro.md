Tidy Columns sets widths and margins, based on your configuration, with the goal that any elements along the vertical axis that should be aligned, are. **This plugin will not set layout for you. Layout is *your* job**.

See the [Tidy Columns README](https://github.com/goodguyry/postcss-tidy-columns/blob/master/README.md) or [Wiki](https://github.com/goodguyry/postcss-tidy-columns/wiki) for more about configuring the plugin.
